High Fidelity prototype

1. Expand the low fidelity prototype developed for A1 into a High Fidelity prototype. Use Figma to work with your team mates  and share the prototype link to your social contacts to get more detailed feedback on specific design aspects. 
2. Use these remote experimental settings to scale up the results and assess user preferences on specific open design issues. This can be achieved by defining a couple of slightly different prototype versions (varying only for the features to be tested) and performing an A/B testing on the experimental data points that will be returned with the Google Forms. Remember to add also some selector questions, e.g. 1-5, and not only open ended questions to be answered with text!

Web app prototype

1. Based on your high-definition prototype develop a similar UI using one of the web application frameworks for mobile and touch applications, like JQuery Mobile, jQTouch.
2. Test your new prototype with real users (record and take notes for documentations).
3. Compare and improve the prototype based on the outcomes from the real usersâ€™ feedbacks.

Write a report of 2-4 pages including some picts and main results from test of high definition Figma prototype, the choice of Web App tools, detailed description of the implementation (and link to it), pictures of your Web App prototype, and the results of the user tests.
